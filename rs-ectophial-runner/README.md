# rs-ectophial-runner
Old Pascal script I wrote in 2009, kept here for posterity. My first non-trivial program. It "plays" RuneScape, in particular the Ectofuntus activity. It ran in old versions of [Simba](http://wizzup.org/simba/).

Note that I wrote this way before I ever heard of "best practices".  This code is not meant to demonstrate my coding abilities - it is for the sole purpose of looking back fondly upon.
