# rs-ectophial-runner
Old Pascal script I wrote in 2009, kept here for posterity. My first non-trivial program. It "plays" RuneScape, in particular the Ectofuntus activity. It can theoretically be run in very old versions of [Simba](http://wizzup.org/simba/), though I don't recommend it - this script has been unmaintained for five years, and the game has evolved a lot since.

Note that I wrote this way before I ever heard of "best practices".
